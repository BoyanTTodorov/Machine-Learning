"Learning with a teacher"

The algorithm learns from labeled data (input + correct answer).

Like a student learning with flashcardsâ€”question on one side, answer on the other.

âœ… Use cases: Spam detection, predicting house prices, image classification.

ðŸ§  Example:
If we give a model lots of pictures of cats and dogs with labels, it learns to tell them apart.
