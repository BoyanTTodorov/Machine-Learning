# Machine-Learning
ðŸ”¹ S - Supervised Learning
"Learning with a teacher"

The algorithm learns from labeled data (input + correct answer).

Like a student learning with flashcardsâ€”question on one side, answer on the other.

âœ… Use cases: Spam detection, predicting house prices, image classification.

ðŸ§  Example:
If we give a model lots of pictures of cats and dogs with labels, it learns to tell them apart.

ðŸ”¹ U - Unsupervised Learning
"Learning without a teacher"

The algorithm is given only input data, no correct answers.

It tries to find patterns or groups by itself.

âœ… Use cases: Customer segmentation, recommendation systems, anomaly detection.

ðŸ§  Example:
Give it a pile of animal pictures with no labelsâ€”it groups similar ones together.

ðŸ”¹ R - Reinforcement Learning
"Learning by trial and error"

The algorithm interacts with an environment, learns by rewards and punishments.

Like training a dogâ€”give a treat when it gets it right.

âœ… Use cases: Game AI (like AlphaGo), robotics, self-driving cars.

ðŸ§  Example:
A robot learns to walkâ€”tries things, falls down, eventually learns what works.

Bonus: Two more you might hear about
Self-supervised Learning: A mix between supervised and unsupervisedâ€”uses the data itself to create labels.

Semi-supervised Learning: Small amount of labeled data + lots of unlabeled data.
